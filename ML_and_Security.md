- KDD dataset too old now; historic value only
- model impact (more to less): ground truth (good data) > feature selection > algorithm
- anonymaly detecting difficult (impossible?)
    - host to host network paths - curse of dimensionality
    - no ground truth out of the control of the attacked (normality poisioning)
    - hanlon's razor (aka semantic gap) - never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
